=====================

.. warning::
   This module isn't ready for prime time yet, it's still in development.
   These docs are primarily meant to help the pygame developers and
   super-early adopters who are in communication with the developers.
   This API will change.

   Also, this module is a C implementation of most of the features of the
   sdl2_video module. It is currently incomplete.
